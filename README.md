# ABS-projects
This repo is about projects showed by Al Sweigart in his book called Automate the boring stuff.
The person that reads this book has to be careful. Because the book says that sometimes it goes against best practices (for example, some programs use global variables). The aim exposed here is develop the projects in three approaches 1) functional approach 2)OOP approach and 3) Using DDD.
